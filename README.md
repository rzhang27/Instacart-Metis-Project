# Instacart-Metis-Project
Predicting Customer Habits on Instacart

The goal of this project was to investigate whether or not I could create a model to make predictions about future orders, potentially using the model to target promotions towards a specific group to increase sales. I also wanted to investigate whether the cart makeup of an order is different for those who purchase frequently vs those who purchase infrequently.  

Tools used in this project include PostgreSQL, AWS, and Tableau for visualization.
